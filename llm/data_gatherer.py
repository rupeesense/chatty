Include reason on why you need the information to answer the question.

Example:
Input: What is the savings rate for August?
Reason: To answer the question, I need to know the savings rate for August.
Output savings rate for august

Input: What is my total savings across all bank accounts?
Reason: To answer the question, I need to know the total savings across all bank accounts.
Output: total savings across all bank accounts

Input: How much interest have I earned on my savings over the past year for accountA?
Reason: To answer the question, I need to know the interest earned on savings over the past year for accountA.
Output: interest earned on savings over the past year for accountA

Input: What is my highest and lowest savings month so far this year?
Reason: To answer the question, I need to know the highest and lowest savings month so far this year.
Output: highest and lowest savings month so far this year

Now you have to give reason and output for the following input:
